    "We want to explore the effects of market impact in an Optimal Expected Utility sizing framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "* We can only invest in one risky asset S and a risk-free asset R with 0 expected return\n",
    "* $\\frac{\\Delta S_T}{S_0}$ can take values $x_i$ with probabilities $p_i$\n",
    "* Investor has CRRA utility: $$u(w) = \\frac{w^{1-\\gamma}}{1-\\gamma}$$\n",
    "* Market impact is treated as a tax, which is a function of trade size and execution duration: $$\\tau = f(\\kappa, \\Delta t)$$\n",
    "* $\\tau$ is symmetric between entering and exiting\n",
    "* No rebalancing between times 0 and T\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Framework\n",
    "For a wealth fraction $\\kappa$ invested in $S$, we have expected utility:\n",
    "$$E[u] = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\sum_i p_i (1+\\kappa x_i - 2\\tau(\\kappa))^{1-\\gamma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual we want to optimize wrt $\\kappa$ so:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial E[u]}{\\partial \\kappa} = \\sum_i \\frac{p_i (x_i - 2\\frac{\\partial\\tau}{\\partial\\kappa})}{(1+\\kappa x_i - 2\\tau(\\kappa))^{\\gamma}}  = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved analytically for certain distributions and $\\tau$ specs, but in general we'll just solve it numerically."
